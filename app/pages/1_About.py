         in Machine Learning and Econometrics at Aix-Marseille University. All of the data is as of January 2022.
         Further it was queried from the Sorare API https://github.com/sorare/api 
         Thankfully, Sorare provided the data open source. This streamlit app shall represent my skills and be an example for my Data Science Portfolio of Projects. 
         The underlying database for the deployed app is stored at a Snowflake database, which is not publicly available.

st.write(""" First, I want to thank Sorare for providing data open source. Without them, the whole Streamlit App and 
         the university project would not be a great success. So check the Website out at https://sorare.com/ . Further I want to thank University Konstanz and Aix-Marseille University for the high quality education.
         Special thanks to Ms. Lyudmila Grigoryeva and Mr. Winfried Pohlmeier for drastically improving my relevant hard skills. Last but not least, I want to thank Julia Funkner, Alexander Beales, Kevin Polaczek, Daniil Parfenov, Jelena Lelovic, and my parents 
         for all the assistance and happy times in my live. They deserve all the best.
