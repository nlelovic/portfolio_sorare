                NFT card holders. Over the years Sorare managed to incorporate more and more european football leagues and further stepped into

    This app will allow you to browse through the database of the Sorare football cards and also do some basic analysis backed by machine learning methods.
    It is a product of my Master's studies, where newly acquired machine learning and big data techniques should be applied on a dataset of choice.
    This project is part of my data science portfolio to demonstrate my skill set and capabilities as a Data Scientist. And of course offer you a nice experience!
    Make sure to check out the About page, where you can find more info about Sorare and also about me.
    Have fun!
